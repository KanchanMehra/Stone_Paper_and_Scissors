# Stone_Paper_and_Scissors

This is a fun and interactive Stone Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects one option (stone, paper, or scissors), and the computer randomly chooses its move. The game then displays the result — win, lose, or draw — along with both selections. It includes score tracking and a reset option for multiple rounds. The layout is clean and user-friendly, making it easy to play and visually appealing. This game demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and user interaction.
